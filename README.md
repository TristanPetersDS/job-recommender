# Resume-to-Job Category Matching System

This project aims to build a lightweight, interpretable system that maps user resumes to relevant job categories and retrieves matching job descriptions. The goal is to support job seekers in identifying roles aligned with their experience using text classification and content-based recommendation techniques.

## 📌 Overview

- **Classification**: Assign each resume to a predefined job sector using supervised learning models.
- **Recommendation**: Retrieve top job postings from a labeled dataset using cosine similarity and TF-IDF feature vectors.
- **Scope**: Focused on practical, interpretable methods — no deep learning or API integrations involved.
